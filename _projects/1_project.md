<p>
    <strong>Google Scholar</strong>, a free web search engine launched in 2004, provides easy and accurate access to scholarly literature across various formats and disciplines. Key features include: <br>
    <p class="caption">
    📕Access to literature with links<br>
    🗝️Citation analysis tools<br>
    📝Related articles suggestions<br>
    🔢Extensive legal database of US cases<br>
    </p>

<p>
    Reflecting on this UI/UX design project for Google Scholar, I have gained a wealth of insights and valuable experience that has expanded my understanding of the design process. Working with Figma as a design tool, I was able to collaborate seamlessly with my team, turning our collective ideas into functional prototypes.
    <br>
    One key learning from this project was the importance of user research and empathy. By employing various research methods and considering real user needs, we were able to identify critical pain points and develop targeted solutions. This user-centric approach allowed us to avoid assumptions and create designs that genuinely resonated with our target audience.
    <br>
    The brainstorming sessions with my team were incredibly enriching, as each member brought unique perspectives and expertise to the table. These diverse ideas culminated in the creation of three distinct prototypes, which we then subjected to usability testing. This crucial step in the process provided valuable feedback, ensuring our designs were not only innovative but also practical and user-friendly.
    <br>
    Another significant takeaway was the value of iteration in the design process. As we refined our prototypes based on user feedback, I realized that continuous improvement is vital for delivering a product that truly meets users' expectations. This iterative approach helped us to address any shortcomings and incorporate enhancements for an optimal user experience.
    <br>
    Collaborating in Figma proved to be an effective way of streamlining our design process. The tool's real-time collaboration capabilities allowed us to work together seamlessly, share feedback, and make adjustments as needed. This was crucial in ensuring that our final design was polished and cohesive.
    <br>
    In conclusion, this project has been an immensely rewarding experience, deepening my appreciation for UI/UX design principles and the power of collaboration. The knowledge and skills acquired during this journey will undoubtedly serve me well in future design endeavors.
